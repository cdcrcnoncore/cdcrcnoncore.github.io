        Can you give a general discription of the interview with some interview questions? 
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        Online round: On Hackerrank, About 15 MCQs and 3 codes only in Python. Duration was 1 hour. MCQs consisted of code snippet outputs or bugs and problems on probability. I did not perform well in this round as I did not have in depth knowledge of Python, I mostly program in other languages. Problems were not difficult.<br>

Interview: 2 interviewers, duration was about 30 minutes. Interview revolved around my projects and resume. 
They mostly asked about my ML related projects although I had listed others too. Asked about my experience with Python, git, linux and ML. I told I was most comfortable with C++ and Java, but coding in Python is not an issue, have good experience with git, linux.<br> 
What metrics are used for measuring performance of a predictive model?
 I talked about precision and recall, but I got a little confused between the two on a cross question. Was asked if I knew about f-1 score, which I didn't.
They also asked about the application of different types of deep learning models, to which I answered by telling about some different neural networks and the domains where they are mostly used. I talked about the 2 projects I had done in computer vision with pytorch, I was asked why pytorch, to which I replied that it is a new DL library which is widely used in academia and offers good performance and functionality. Also talked about how it also supports Cuda which makes training of models much faster.<br>
Why are you interested in this internship and profile?<br>
I told that this was a very interesting profile to me as it was a balance of two things I like, working on latest technologies and business, finance. I was asked if I follow stocks, to which I said yes but not very regularly. Talked a bit about what Nifty and other indices are. 
I asked questions about the type of projects in this internship and the current work from home situation.

        How did you prepare for it?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        Personally, I did not really prepare for this job description. I was more focused on preparing for SDE profiles, getting selected here came as a surprise. But, I would suggest to brush up your combinatorics and probability which I did for two days before the first round. brilliant.org is an excellent website for this purpose. Experience with Python will also help, I was not much aware of things such as lambda expressions, generators in Python.

        Any tips for juniors?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        For this or a similar profile, get your basics crystal clear in Python programming. Solve problems for a few days on probability distributions. Have ML related projects on your resume and talk to the interviewers like in a conversation, so you can talk more about your strong points.
