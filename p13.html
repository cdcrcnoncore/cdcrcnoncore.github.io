        How did you prepare for it?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        The prep required you to have good and very fast calculation skills. Along with that you needed to be good in LR skills. <br>
For calculation practice you can visit rankyourbrain.com and since I was preparing for CAT I didn't do much for LR.

        Any tips for juniors?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        1. Be calm and patient. 2. Don't fret too much over written tests. Sleep well before the test so that you are mentally at peak while attempting the paper. 3. Practice well for the written tests and try to increase your speed. 4 Interview might become grilling don't show them that you are scared even if you are wrong or they are grilling your.
